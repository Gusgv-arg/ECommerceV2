E-CommerceV2: this proyect it's a crucial part of my studies to be able to approach my Final Proyect at Henry's bootcamp.

It is based on a course I took at Udemy that tought me several important features as user signin, admin panel, bootstrap, mongoose, payment method, email notifications, uploading files to Cloudinary, etc.

It's been hard work to get here, and will continue studying to become a proffessional web developer!
