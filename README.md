E-CommerceV2: this proyect it's a crucial part of my studies to be able to approach my Final Proyect at Henry's bootcamp.

It is based on a course I bought at Udemy that tought me several important features as user signin, admin panel, bootstrap, mongoose, payment method, etc.

It's been hard work to get here, and will continue studying!
